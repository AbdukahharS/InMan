# InMan

**InMan** is an Inventory Management System for desktop, built using **Nextron** (Next.js and Electron). It is designed for businesses that require supplier, intake, warehouse, customer, and sales management, all within a single app.

This is my first desktop application and my first project handling large amounts of data, so there may be bugs and potential security risks. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to report them by filing an issue ðŸ˜Š.

## Features
- Supplier management
- Warehouse and intake management
- Customer and sales tracking
- Cross-platform desktop support (via Electron)

## Setup

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdukahharS/InMan
cd InMan
npm install
```
Once the installation is complete, you're good to go!
